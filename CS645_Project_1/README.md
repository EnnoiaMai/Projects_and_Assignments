# CS645 Project 1 - Packback (Inventory), Perl/CGI/JS/SQL, Sessions and Cookies

**Note**: For security purposes, the values for the host, port number, database, username, and password are omitted, and thus
          a connection will not be made to the database. Also, the insert statements and file for creating the tables in the
          database are also left out.

Details about this project are explained on my website. Please visit my [Portfolio](https://ennoiamai.github.io/Portfolio/web_applications/CS645/project1_details.html).

Here is a preview of what the website looks like.
