    <div id="history_center_content">
        <p>Jacques Cartier was the first European to make land on what is now
            known in modern day as Montreal in 1535. The area was inhabited by
            the Iroquois. Thereafter in 1609, Samuel de Champlain attempted to
            create a trading post for fur in the area, which became a part of
            New France since the country had goals to expand. There were missionaries
            who sailed with him and including Paul de Chomedey, who founded and
            established the colony named "Ville-Marie de Montreal". This location
            which intersects both the St Lawrence and Ottawa rivers was ideal for
            trade and communication. Although the French struggled against the Iroquois, it
            wasn't until 1760 that the French had to give in to the British after losing the war.
        </p>

        <p>By the late 1800s, Montreal prospered commercially with the fur trade
            being avenues for merchants. A trade system that took advantage of Montreal's
            ports further contributed to the growth of the city. For a short time, Montreal
            was the capital of of the United Canadas between 1844 and 1849.
        </p>

        <p>From 1929 to 1939, the Great Depression reached Canada leading to losses
            in companies and prices and increasing unemployment. In 1944, the Conscription
            Crisis occurred leading to protests against enforced enlistment during
            World War II.
        </p>

        <p>Montreal's status as a cultural hub was even more convincing after
            the events of Expo 67 which was a general exhibition or a World Fair hosted
            by the city. The 1976 Summer Olympics was also hosted in Montreal which
            solidified the city's cultural impression. What is notable was the
            merging and blending of French and English cultures due to historical
            developments which facilitated the emergence of this diverse and unique
            cultures in terms of the food, the interactions, and the atmosphere
            of Montreal.
