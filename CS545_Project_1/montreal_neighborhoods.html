                <h3>Old Montreal</h3>
                <p>This district is most representative of Montreal's history as it dates
                    back to the city's beginnings. The area contains many restaurants,
                    shops, and sites that tourists should visit. The architecture of the buildings
                    adds onto the unique "feel" of Montreal. </p>

                <h3>Place Jacques-Cartier</h3>
                <p>A square within Old Montreal, this area acts as the meeting place for many
                    of its residents and newcomers. It can also be viewed as the entrance
                    into Old Montreal.</p>

                <p>A business district in Old Montreal that houses what is known as Montreal's
                    underground city. This "Underground City" consists of hundreds of shops
                    and restaurants but is more of an indoor city than its literal label.</p>

                    to many ethnic and asian foods and culture. Though called "Chinatown",
                    this area includes several other ethnic food places such as Japanese, Korean, and
                    Vietnamese restaurants.</p>
