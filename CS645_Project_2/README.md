**Note**: For security purposes, the connectionURL was deleted from DBHelper.java, and thus a connection will not be
          made to the database that I connected to. Also, it should be noted that the files under WEB-INF, in an
          actual commercial product, would be placed under WEB-INF/classes and the files under protected_jsp would
          placed under WEB-INF/jsp. The folder here on Github only shows the relevant files that I useed for Java 
          Web Services.
