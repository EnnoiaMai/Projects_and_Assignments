**Note**: For security purposes, the connectionURL was deleted from DBHelper.java, and thus a connection will not be
          made to the database that I connected to. Also, it should be noted that the files under WEB-INF, in an
          actual commercial product, would be placed under WEB-INF/classes and the files under protected_jsp would
          placed under WEB-INF/jsp. The folder here on Github only shows the relevant files that I useed for Java 
          Web Services.
          
**Datbase Images**: The images of the products were on the jadran server under my account for project 1. This is because
                    project 2 was a continuation of project 1 except that it dealt with the client side, the website used to
                    purchase the products, and essentially the UI.
